## Practice Exercises ✅

Here are some suggested practice tasks for each topic to strengthen your understanding:

* Variables & Types

  * Declare variables with `let`, `const`, `var` and print them.
  * Make a small script that swaps values of two variables.
  * Practice converting types: e.g. convert string to number, boolean to string, etc.

* Operators & Control Flow

  * Write a calculator function that takes two numbers and an operator (as a string) and returns the result.
  * Create a script that checks if a number is even or odd.
  * Use `switch` to build a simple “day-of-week” to text converter.

* Loops

  * Print numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.
  * Use `while` to simulate a countdown.
  * Given an array, loop through it and print only the even-indexed elements.

* Functions

  * Make a function that calculates BMI given height and weight.
  * Write a function that takes a string and returns its reverse.
  * Make a higher-order function: a function that takes another function and calls it after logging something.

* Objects & Arrays

  * Create an object to represent a book (title, author, pages), then add a method to describe the book.
  * Create an array of numbers, then use `.map()` to square each number, `.filter()` to pick only > 10, and `.reduce()` to sum them.
  * Use destructuring to extract values from objects / arrays.

* Modern JS

  * Use template literals to build a sentence with variables.
  * Split some code into modules: e.g. utils.js and main.js, and use `export` / `import`.
  * Practice using spread/rest in a function: e.g. sum all numbers passed to it.

* DOM + Events

  * Build a simple HTML page with a button, then change the text of a `<p>` when the button is clicked.
  * Create a to-do list in the browser: add items, remove items, mark as done.
  * Use event delegation: e.g., clicking on any list item triggers an alert with its content.

* Async Basics

  * Simulate a delayed API call using `setTimeout` + callback.
  * Write a simple promise that resolves after 2 seconds, then `await` it.

* Debugging

  * Introduce a bug in your code on purpose (e.g. typo, wrong variable name) and use DevTools to find/fix it.
  * Catch an error in a promise using `.catch()` or `try/catch`.
